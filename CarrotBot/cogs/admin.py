Some jokes may be punished more heavily than others.

You are allowed to have civil discussions about certain topics, but flamewars will be punished.
Spreading Misinformation Is Discouraged.

If you want to say a joke that can be seen as discriminatory, think about how others will read it, if it's actually funny, if it is clearly intended as a joke, and if it could be crossing the line. That decision is up to you, but if a staff member deems that it has crossed the line, you'll be muted and you can't complain. Remember that this is a minecraft discord server, and although we all find certain jokes funny, the bar will be lower than that of in a personal friend group.''',

Eg2. "Hypixel Is Sooo Gay Man, All These Lagbacks Are Soo Gay"
